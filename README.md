# QA Automation Template for API Testing

This repository serves as a template for setting up a new repository for writing API auto tests. It's tailored for developers who require a quick start to API testing with Python.

## Features
- Configured with a modern Python stack: Python 3, PyTest, Requests, Behave, Allure for reporting, Graphene for GraphQL.
- Docker environment pre-configured for isolated testing scenarios.
- Make CLI commands for straightforward local development and operations.
- Comprehensive CI checks integrated with GitHub Actions (code quality, security checks, and more).
- Pre-configured files for contribution guidelines, security policy, and pull requests.

## Why Use This Template?
Setting up a new repository for API testing often involves repetitive configuration that can be time-consuming. This template provides a pre-configured environment to streamline the creation and setup of API auto tests, allowing developers to focus on writing tests and not on setup.
